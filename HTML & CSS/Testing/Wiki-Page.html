    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <p>
        The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear native to Eurasia and North America. Of the carnivorans, it is rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more compactly built than females.
